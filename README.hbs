A collection of data validation tools.

# major changes in vet 5 

version 5 includes several breaking changes from version 4, mostly designed to improve interoperability with TS

- `optional` no longer accepts `null`, just `undefined`.  This is to bring it inline with TypeScript and many other libraries' interpretation of optional values.
- `isShape` now converts all `T | undefined` properties to optional properties in the validator schema type.  This eliminates the requirement to explicitly define "optional" properties as `undefined`.
- `accepts` and `returns` have now been moved from `vet/utils` to `vet/functions`, where they should have been in the first place.

in addition, v5 includes:

- a new `isTuple` utility
